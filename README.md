# Document-Based RAG: Better Option for AI Governance

Welcome to the **Document RAG Guide**... a dual-memory, OpenSearch-based approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that delivers answers that are faster, clearer, and governed by design. The repo houses two fully working paths:

- **Community / Open-Source Version** - a self-contained demo you can run on a laptop or in an Open Source (free as in beer) type deployment.
- **Enterprise Version** - a production-grade variant that layers in ingest pipelines, NetApp FlexCache, SnapMirror, and other operational muscle.

By storing knowledge as **documents with enriched metadata** (including named entities and provenance tags) instead of opaque vectors alone, the agent gains traceability, reduces hallucinations, and meets demanding audit requirements.

### Project Purpose

This project was developed to address significant limitations inherent in traditional vector-based RAG solutions. Specifically:

- **Performance Shortfalls**: Traditional vector-based RAG, although effective at handling vast unstructured data, often suffers from performance bottlenecks and reduced efficiency during multi-step reasoning tasks. Document-based RAG, complemented by optimized caching and storage layers, bridges this gap.
- **Transparency and Explainability**: Vector embeddings are inherently opaque, limiting interpretability and traceability. Document-based RAG explicitly stores and enriches content with metadata and entity tags, significantly improving transparency, governance, and auditability.

Key objectives include:

- Provide a reference architecture for **Document-based RAG** with explicit short-term (cache) and long-term (authoritative) memory.
- Demonstrate how reinforcement-learning signals can promote proven facts from cache to durable storage.
- Show upgrade paths... from a minimal Python/RAM-disk demo to an enterprise pipeline with ingest pipelines, data connectors using Kafka, and NetApp enterprise storage.

## Benefits Over Vector-Based RAG

Adopting document-based RAG addresses several key limitations of traditional RAG Agents:

- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: OpenSearch indexing with entity enrichment supports complex queries across multiple related pieces of information, enhancing retrieval accuracy.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Explicit metadata and annotations simplify detection and correction of biased data.
- **Improved Compliance and Governance**: Detailed provenance and transparent document metadata facilitate auditability and regulatory compliance.
- **Risk Management**: Significantly reduced hallucinations due to verified and structured context.

### Community vs Enterprise - What Changes?

| Capability                 | Community Edition                               | Enterprise Edition                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data movement**          | Python helper scripts copy docs on demand       | **Connectors / Pipelines** stream CDC events into OpenSearch tiers                |
| **Cache backing store**    | `tmpfs` / RAM-disk on the dev box               | **NetApp FlexCache** for NVMe-speed reads; resiliency via **SnapMirror** replicas |
| **Operational guarantees** | At-least-once copies; manual scripts            | Exactly-once semantics, replay, and audit via pipeline offsets                    |
| **Governance hooks**       | Basic provenance tags                           | Promotion events logged, schema-versioned, and instantly traceable                |
| **Performance**            | Millisecond-level on warm RAM cache             | Sub-50 ms at global scale; hot blocks auto-evicted by FlexCache                   |

> **TL;DR:** start with the community guide for laptops and commodity hardware; switch to the enterprise path when you need 24Ã—7, multi-site, or compliance.
